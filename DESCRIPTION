        Measures and Other Psychometric Instruments
Version: 0.0.1

Description: An extensible repository of accurate, up-to-date functions to score 
    commonly used patient-reported outcome (PRO), quality of life (QOL), and 
    other psychometric and psychological measures.  'PROscorer', together with 
    the 'PROscorerTools' package, is a system to facilitate the incorporation of 
    PRO measures into research studies and clinical settings in a scientifically 
    rigorous and reproducible manner.  These packages and their vignettes are 
    intended to help establish and promote "best practices" to improve the 
    planning, scoring, and reporting of PRO-like measures in research.  
    The 'PROscorer' "Instrument Descriptions" vignette contains descriptions of 
    each instrument scored by 'PROscorer', complete with references.  These 
    instrument descriptions are suitable for inclusion in formal study protocol 
    documents, grant proposals, and manuscript Method sections.  Each 
    'PROscorer' function is composed of helper functions from the 
    'PROscorerTools' package, and users are encouraged to contribute new 
    functions to 'PROscorer'.  More scoring functions are currently in 
    development and will be added in future updates.
