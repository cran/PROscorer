scales}
\usage{
narcc(df, items = NULL, whichScale, minmax = c(0, 3), okmiss = 0.5,
  keepNvalid = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing responses to the CC and/or NAR items, and
possibly other variables.}

\item{items}{(optional) A character vector with the CC or NAR item names, or
a numeric vector indicating the column numbers of the CC or NAR items in
\code{df}.  If \code{items} is omitted, then \code{narcc} will assume
that \code{df} contains \strong{ONLY} the items to be scored (either CC or
NAR items) and no non-scored variables.}

\item{whichScale}{(required) Either \code{"CC"} or \code{"NAR"}, the scale
you wish to score.}

\item{minmax}{A vector of 2 integers with format \code{c(itemMin, itemMax)},
indicating the minimum and maximum possible item responses.  The default
value is \code{c(0, 3)}, and assumes that the item responses are coded from
0 to 3.  If, instead, your item responses are coded from 1 to 4, then enter
\code{c(1, 4)} for this argument.}

\item{okmiss}{(optional) The maximum proportion of items on \code{whichScale}
that a respondent is allowed to have missing and still have their
non-missing items scored (and prorated). If the proportion of missing items
for a respondent is greater than \code{okmiss}, then the respondent will be
assigned a value of \code{NA} for their scale score.  The default value is
\code{0.50}, and this generally should not be changed.}

\item{keepNvalid}{(optional) Logical value indicating whether a variable
containing the number of valid, non-missing items for each respondent
should be returned in a data frame with the scale score.  The default is
\code{FALSE}.  Set to \code{TRUE} to return this variable, which will be
named \code{"whichScale_N"} (with whatever name you gave to the
\code{whichScale} argument).  Most users should omit this argument
entirely.  This argument might be removed from future versions of the
package, so please let me know if you think this argument useful and would
rather it remain a part of the function.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing a variable containing the scored scale, named either
\code{"CC"} or \code{"NAR"}.  Scores are scales to have range 0 to 100.

Optionally, the data frame can additionally have a variable containing the
number of valid item responses on the scale for each respondent (if
\code{keepNvalid = TRUE}, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).

\description{
Scores the Cognitive Causation (CC) and Negative Affect in Risk
(NAR) scales, two scales measuring intuitive elements of cancer risk
perception (see references).
}
\details{
The CC scale originally contained 10 items (Hay et al., 2014).  Later,
evidence that 3 of the items might be measurement non-invariant across
important subgroups led to the recommendation to omit these 3 items and score
a 7-item version of the CC scale (Baser et al., 2016).  When \code{whichScale
= "CC"} the \code{narcc} function will accept and score either 7 or 10
CC items, although the 7-item version is recommended.  The NAR scale has 6
items, and the \code{narcc} function will accept only 6 NAR items when
\code{whichScale = "NAR"}.

If you want to score both the CC and NAR scales, then you need to run the
\code{narcc} function twice, once for CC and again for NAR.
}
\note{
The \code{narcc} function assumes that your item data are numerically
coded from 0 to 3 (i.e., with 0 = "Strongly Disagree" and 3 = "Strongly
Agree").  However, your item data might instead be coded from 1 to 4.  If
this is the case, you MUST let the \code{narcc} function know this by
using the \code{minmax} argument, specifically, \code{minmax = c(1, 4)}.

\examples{
# Make fake data for the example
nardat <- PROscorerTools::makeFakeData(nitems = 6, values = 0:3,
                                       propmiss = 0.40, prefix = "nar")
ccdat <- PROscorerTools::makeFakeData(nitems = 7, values = 0:3,
                                      propmiss = 0.40, prefix = "cc",
                                      id = TRUE)

# The nardat data frame contains ONLY NAR items, so can omit "items" argument
narcc(nardat, whichScale = "NAR")

# The ccdat data frame contains an "ID" variable, so need to use "items" arg
names(ccdat)

# The "items" argument can be either:
#     (1) the numeric vector indexing the location of the items in df, or
#     (2) a character vector of the item names
narcc(ccdat, items = 2:8, whichScale = "CC")

cc_names <- c("cc1", "cc2", "cc3", "cc4", "cc5", "cc6", "cc7")
narcc(ccdat, items = cc_names, whichScale = "CC")
