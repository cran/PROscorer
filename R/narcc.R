#' @description Scores the Cognitive Causation (CC) and Negative Affect in Risk
#'   (NAR) scales, two scales measuring intuitive elements of cancer risk
#'   perception (see references).
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing responses to the CC and/or NAR items, and
#'   possibly other variables.
#' @param items (optional) A character vector with the CC or NAR item names, or
#'   a numeric vector indicating the column numbers of the CC or NAR items in
#'   \code{df}.  If \code{items} is omitted, then \code{narcc} will assume
#'   that \code{df} contains \strong{ONLY} the items to be scored (either CC or
#'   NAR items) and no non-scored variables.
#' @param whichScale (required) Either \code{"CC"} or \code{"NAR"}, the scale
#'   you wish to score.
#' @param minmax A vector of 2 integers with format \code{c(itemMin, itemMax)},
#'   indicating the minimum and maximum possible item responses.  The default
#'   value is \code{c(0, 3)}, and assumes that the item responses are coded from
#'   0 to 3.  If, instead, your item responses are coded from 1 to 4, then enter
#'   \code{c(1, 4)} for this argument.
#' @param okmiss (optional) The maximum proportion of items on \code{whichScale}
#'   that a respondent is allowed to have missing and still have their
#'   non-missing items scored (and prorated). If the proportion of missing items
#'   for a respondent is greater than \code{okmiss}, then the respondent will be
#'   assigned a value of \code{NA} for their scale score.  The default value is
#'   \code{0.50}, and this generally should not be changed.
#' @param keepNvalid (optional) Logical value indicating whether a variable
#'   containing the number of valid, non-missing items for each respondent
#'   should be returned in a data frame with the scale score.  The default is
#'   \code{FALSE}.  Set to \code{TRUE} to return this variable, which will be
#'   named \code{"whichScale_N"} (with whatever name you gave to the
#'   \code{whichScale} argument).  Most users should omit this argument
#'   entirely.  This argument might be removed from future versions of the
#'   package, so please let me know if you think this argument useful and would
#'   rather it remain a part of the function.
#'
#' @details
#' The CC scale originally contained 10 items (Hay et al., 2014).  Later,
#' evidence that 3 of the items might be measurement non-invariant across
#' important subgroups led to the recommendation to omit these 3 items and score
#' a 7-item version of the CC scale (Baser et al., 2016).  When \code{whichScale
#' = "CC"} the \code{narcc} function will accept and score either 7 or 10
#' CC items, although the 7-item version is recommended.  The NAR scale has 6
#' items, and the \code{narcc} function will accept only 6 NAR items when
#' \code{whichScale = "NAR"}.
#'
#' If you want to score both the CC and NAR scales, then you need to run the
#' \code{narcc} function twice, once for CC and again for NAR.
#'
#' @note
#' The \code{narcc} function assumes that your item data are numerically
#' coded from 0 to 3 (i.e., with 0 = "Strongly Disagree" and 3 = "Strongly
#' Agree").  However, your item data might instead be coded from 1 to 4.  If
#' this is the case, you MUST let the \code{narcc} function know this by
#' using the \code{minmax} argument, specifically, \code{minmax = c(1, 4)}.
#'
#' @return
#' A data frame containing a variable containing the scored scale, named either
#' \code{"CC"} or \code{"NAR"}.  Scores are scales to have range 0 to 100.
#'
#' Optionally, the data frame can additionally have a variable containing the
#' number of valid item responses on the scale for each respondent (if
#' \code{keepNvalid = TRUE}, but this option might be removed in future package
#' updates).
