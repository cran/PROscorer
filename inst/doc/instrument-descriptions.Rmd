# Introduction:

This vignette includes descriptions of the instruments scored by the
[PROscorer](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PROscorer) package.  

__PROBLEM:__ Patient reported outcome (PRO) measures and other PRO-like
instruments are often poorly and inadequately described in formal research
protocol documents and in published reports of study results.

__CONSEQUENCES:__ In protocols, this makes it difficult or impossible to
evaluate the suitability of the PRO measures as study outcomes, including
whether the proposed analysis plans are appropriate.   The same consequences
apply to published study results.  In addition, poor PRO measure descriptions in
published studies hinder the ability interpret, replicate, and reproduce study
results.  Altogether, this impedes the scientific progress of research that
relies upon PRO and similar measures.

__SOLUTION:__ Create a repository of high-quality descriptions of specific PRO
instruments (i.e., this vignette document), written according to explicit
guidelines for describing PRO measures in research protocols and papers.

This document is intended to ease the burden of writing research protocols and
manuscripts for studies with quality of life (QOL) or other patient-reported
outcome (PRO) measures as endpoints.

The descriptions are written with sufficient detail to be included in formal 
research protocol documents that utilize the instruments as outcome measures. 
They are also suitable for the "Measures" subsection of manuscripts reporting 
the results of such studies (potentially with editing, to meet word limits). 
They were written with these purposes in mind, and follow the below _"Guidelines
for Describing PRO Measures"_ that I developed based on several sources of "best
practices" for describing PRO measures (references coming soon) and on my 
personal experience as a protocol review committee chair at a large cancer
center.  


# How to Use These Descriptions:

Each instrument description is complete with relevant references.  In most
cases, the description can be copied and pasted directly into your document with
only very minor modifications.

The following modifications are needed:  

*  Move the references to the References section of the your document, and
update in-text citation numbers accordingly.

*  If not all of the scored scales of the instrument are of interest to the
study objectives, then add a sentence indicating the focal scale scores.

# Guidelines for Describing PRO Measures:

I developed the following guidelines during my years of service as a chair of 
the Biostatistics Protocol Review Committee at a large cancer treatment and 
research institution.  If you would like to contribute a scoring function to the 
PROscorer package, please use these guidelines to write a description of your 
instrument.  I plan to update these guidelines soon into a more user-friendly
checklist, but this should get you started.

Information to Include in Descriptions of PRO Measures:

1.  The total number of questions/items on the instrument(s), their response
format (e.g., 5-point Likert scale, True/False, etc.), and the time period for
which respondents are asked to consider each item (e.g., “In past week, how
often … ”).

2.	The names of any subscale scores that the instrument yields, descriptions of
the specific constructs that each of these subscales are intended to measure,
the number of items included on each subscale, the range of scores that is
possible on each subscale, the interpretation of higher scores (e.g., higher
scores indicate more/less severe symptom levels), and, if available, reliability
coefficients (e.g., internal consistency, test-retest) for each subscale score
and, if relevant, for the instrument’s total score.

    a.	If not all of the instrument’s scales are relevant to evaluating the
    study objective, please indicate which scale scores will be utilized.
    b.  Many PROM scores have validated cut-points that divide the scores into 2
    or more range categories believed to be clinically or diagnostically
    relevant.  If the protocol PROM scores will be categorized, provide the
    score cut-points or ranges defining each category as well as the clinical
    interpretation of each category.

3.	The PROM’s scoring instructions, or a citation and reference to a publication
containing the scoring instructions.

    a.  A citation and reference to a publication containing the scoring
    instructions, if available, is sufficient.  Often, the scoring instructions
    are included in the report of the PROM’s original psychometric validation. 
    b.  If the scoring instructions are unpublished, as might be the case with a
    newly developed PROM, they must be included in the protocol, possibly as an
    appendix.
    c.  Please also cite the _PROscorer_ R package and this vignette document
    (see previous section).

4.	Estimates of how long it will take study participants to complete each PROM,
as well as an estimate of how long it will take them to complete the full
battery of PROMs.


# Instrument Descriptions: 

## Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)
The **Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)** is a multidimensional self-report
measure of female sexual functioning**[REF 1]**.  It asks women to rate its 19
items according to "the past 4 weeks" using a Likert-type response format.  Four
of the items are scored from 1 to 5, and fifteen are scored from 0 to 5 (with 0
corresponding to response option "Did not attempt intercourse").  It takes
approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.

In additional to the FSFI Total score, the FSFI produces 6 subscale scores
corresponding to distinct sexual function domains: Desire (2 items), Arousal (4
items), Lubrication (4 items), Orgasm (3 items), Satisfaction (3 items), and
Pain (3 items).  The FSFI scoring algorithm sums the items on each subscale and
then scales the sums so that each subscale has a maximum possible score of 6. 
The subscales have a minimum possible score of 0 except for Desire and
Satisfaction, which have minimum possible scores of 1.2 and 0.8, respectively. 
This is because those two subscales contain the four items scored 1 to 5
(instead of 0 to 5).  The FSFI total score is the sum of the 6 subscale scores
and ranges from 2 to 36.  Higher scores indicate better functioning for all
scores.  Accurate scoring for the FSFI is available in the _PROscorer_ R
package using the __`fsfi()`__ function**[REF 2]**.

The initial FSFI validation study**[REF 1]** reported excellent internal
consistency reliability for the FSFI total score (Cronbach’s α = 0.97) and
subscales (Cronbach’s α range = 0.89 to 0.96).  A FSFI total score of 26.55 or
less has been validated as a diagnostic cut off score suggestive of female
sexual dysfunction**[REF 3]**.  The FSFI has also been validated for assessing
sexual function among sexually active female cancer survivors**[REF 4]**.

## Cognitive Causation (CC) and Negative Affect in Risk (NAR)
The **Cognitive Causation (CC)** and **Negative Affect in Risk (NAR)** scales
are two new measures of intuitive, gut-level aspects of cancer risk
perception**[REF 1]**.  The CC scale measures the extent to which respondents
believe that thoughts about cancer risk can encourage the development of the
disease, and that minimizing such thoughts can actually reduce cancer risk.  It
originally contained 10 items**[REF 1]**, but it is recommended to score only 7
items**[REF 2]**.  The NAR scale contains 6 items and measures negative
anticipatory affect, or negative emotions (e.g., fear) generated during cancer
risk information processing.  Both the CC and NAR items have 4, Likert-type
response options that are assigned numeric scores: Strongly Disagree = 0,
Disagree = 1, Agree = 2, and Strongly Agree = 3.  Each instrument takes
approximately 2-5 minutes to complete.

The preferred scoring method is to first calculate the mean of the item scores,
and then transform that mean to range from 0 to 100.  Higher scores indicate
greater levels of the constructs being measured**[REF 2]**.  A score should only
be assigned to respondents who validly completed at least half of items on a
given scale.  The CC and NAR scales can be accurately scored using the
__`narcc()`__ function in the _PROscorer_ R package **[REF 3]**.

Both scales have had consistently high reliability across diverse samples, with
Cronbach's alpha coefficients all 0.89 or higher**[REF 1]**.  The items have
also demonstrated measurement invariance across highly diverse samples**[REF
2]**.

## EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0)
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30
Quality of Life Questionnaire (version 3.0) is a 30-item questionnaire designed
to assess the quality of life of cancer patients**[REF 1]**.  The 30 items of
the QLQ-C30 yield both multi-item scale scores and single-item scores, for a
total of 16 distinct scores.  These include one Global Health Status/QoL scale
(2 items), five functional scales (Physical Functioning, 5 items; Role
Functioning, 2 items; Emotional Functioning, 4 items; Cognitive Functioning, 2
items; and Social Functioning, 2 items), three symptom scales (Fatigue, 3 items;
Nausea and Vomiting, 2 items; and Pain, 2 items), six single item symptom scores
(Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, and Financial
Difficulties; all from single items), and the more recently validated overall
summary score (calculated from the other scores, excluding Global Health
Status/QoL and Financial Difficulties)**[REF 2]**.  The questionnaire asks
patients to indicate the extent to which they have experienced each of the
problems “during the past week” on a 4-point Likert-type scale from “Not at all”
to “Very much”.  The 2 exceptions are the 2 items of the Global Health
Status/QoL scale, which patients are asked to rate on a 7-point scale from “Very
poor” to “Excellent”.

The scoring procedure for the QLQ-C30**[REF 3]** transforms all of the scale and
single-item scores to range from 0 to 100.  High scores for the Global Health
Status/QoL scale represents high QoL, high scores for the functional scales
represent high/healthy levels of functioning,  but high scores for the symptom
scales/items represent high levels of symptomatology/problems.  The newer
overall summary score also ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating
better functioning and lower levels of symptoms.  Accurate scoring for the EORTC
QLQ-C30 (version 3.0), including the newer overall summary score, is available
in the _PROscorer_ R package using the __`qlq_c30()`__ function**[REF 4]**.  The
QLQ-C30 has been extensively validated and is widely used in clinical trials. 
The multi-item scales generally have good internal consistency reliability
coefficients**[REF 1]**.
